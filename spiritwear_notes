for building offering:

input:
	program id, entered by user in dialog

output:
	a bunch of recolored prepress files (perhaps with artwork imported from program folder "graphics" folders)
	sample folder formatting:
		[program id]_master folder
			pngs folder
			prepresses folder
				FD-161_1000_Prepress.ai
				FD-161Y_1000_Prepress.ai
				etc
			[program id]_offering.ai // this is the main "master" file that contains all the film strips and param color info

expected behavior
	input a program id, for each unique garment, open a blank converted template


for producing prod files:

input
	program id, entered by user in dialog

output:
	a folder of print ready files with roster info input 

expected behavior:
	user runs script and enters program id
	parse data to define an array of garments needed and populate the necessary roster data for each
	navigate to program folder and identify prepresses folder
	loop garments needed array to open each necessary prepress and create a production file for each 
		garment which includes each roster entry as individual print ready pdfs.
